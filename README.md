# Guidance-Video-Creator-on-Synthensia-Platform-AI-text-to-video
Creating a guidance video for the Synthesia platform, with integrated visuals and AI technology explanations, requires a structured approach. Below is an example Python script to automate parts of the video creation process using Synthesia's API (assuming API access) and AI-driven video script generation.
Workflow for the Video Creation

    Scriptwriting:
        Use AI (e.g., OpenAI's GPT API) to generate the script for the video based on a structured prompt.

    Visual Integration:
        Integrate the AI-generated script with Synthesia for automated video generation using an avatar.

    Video Production:
        Define scenes, transitions, and visual aids that align with the content.

Python Code Example

This script demonstrates automating the scriptwriting and Synthesia video generation process:

import requests

# Step 1: Generate Script Using GPT
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
def generate_script(topic, target_audience):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {OPENAI_API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    prompt = (f"Create a video script about using the Synthesia platform. "
              f"Target audience: {target_audience}. "
              f"Explain key features, benefits, and a step-by-step guide to getting started.")
    data = {
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": 800
    }
    response = requests.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/completions", headers=headers, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()["choices"][0]["text"]
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to generate script: {response.text}")

# Step 2: Generate Video Using Synthesia API
SYNTHESIA_API_KEY = "your_synthesia_api_key"
def create_synthesia_video(script, avatar_id="default_avatar", language="en-US"):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {SYNTHESIA_API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "script": script,
        "avatar_id": avatar_id,
        "language": language,
        "title": "Synthesia Guidance Video"
    }
    response = requests.post("https://api.synthesia.io/videos", headers=headers, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to create video: {response.text}")

# Step 3: Automate Video Creation Process
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Generate the script
        script = generate_script(topic="Synthesia Platform Overview", target_audience="Content Creators")
        print("Generated Script:", script)
        
        # Create the video
        video_response = create_synthesia_video(script)
        print("Video Creation Response:", video_response)
        
        print(f"Video URL: {video_response.get('url', 'Not available yet')}")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error:", e)

Features of the Code:

    Script Generation:
        Uses OpenAI's GPT API for generating an engaging script tailored to the Synthesia platform.

    Synthesia Integration:
        Automates the video creation process with Synthesia, leveraging its API for avatar-based video production.

    Customizable Workflow:
        Allows customization of the avatar, language, and target audience for varied requirements.

Prerequisites:

    Obtain API keys for OpenAI and Synthesia.
    Set up an avatar on Synthesia.
    Install dependencies using:

    pip install requests

Next Steps:

    Review and refine the script generated by AI for accuracy and engagement.
    Enhance visuals within Synthesia by uploading custom assets or creating templates.
    Deliver the final video or embed it directly on a website or training platform.

This approach combines automation with creativity, streamlining video production for a professional outcome.
